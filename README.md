# UDACITY Traffic Sign Classifier

## The Goal of this Project

The goal of this project is to use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. 

## Summary

In summary, I complete this project by:  

1. Load the data set 
2. Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
3. Design, train and test a model architecture
4. Use the model to make predictions on new images
5. Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images

The project repo from Udacity can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project)

Data set used in this project is from [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
